    recommended that you set up an Amazon SNS topic and specify it in your\n\t\t\t\t\tinitiate
    job request so that Amazon Glacier can notify the topic after it completes\n\t\t\t\t\tthe
    job. \n\t\tA job ID will not expire for at least 24 hours after Amazon Glacier

      summary: Upload  Archive
      description: "DescriptionThis operation adds an archive to a vault. For a successful
        upload, your data is durably\n\t\t\tpersisted. In response, Amazon Glacier
        returns the archive ID in the\n\t\t\t\tx-amz-archive-id header of the response.
        You should save the archive ID\n\t\t\treturned so that you can access the
        archive later. You must provide a SHA256 tree hash of the data you are uploading.
        For information about\n\t\t\tcomputing a SHA256 tree hash, see Computing Checksums.
        When uploading an archive, you can optionally specify an archive description
        of up to 1,024\n\t\t\tprintable ASCII characters. Amazon Glacier returns the
        archive description when you\n\t\t\teither retrieve the archive or get the
        vault inventory. Amazon Glacier does not interpret the\n\t\t\tdescription
        in any way. An archive description does not need to be unique. You cannot\n\t\t\tuse
        the description to retrieve or sort the archive list. Except for the optional
        archive description, Amazon Glacier does not support any\n\t\t\tadditional
        metadata for the archives. The archive ID is an opaque sequence of characters\n\t\t\tfrom
        which you cannot infer any meaning about the archive. So you might maintain\n\t\t\tmetadata
        about the archives on the client-side. For more information, see \n\t\t\tWorking
        with Archives in Amazon Glacier.Archives are immutable. After you upload an
        archive, you cannot edit the archive or its\n\t\t\tdescription. RequestsTo
        upload an archive, you use the HTTP POST method and scope the request to the\n\t\t\t\tarchives
        subresource of the vault in which you want to save the\n\t\t\tarchive. The
        request must include the archive payload size, checksum (SHA256 tree hash),\n\t\t\tand
        can optionally include a description of the archive."
