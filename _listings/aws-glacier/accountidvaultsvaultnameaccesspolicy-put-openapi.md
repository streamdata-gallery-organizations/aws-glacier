      summary: Upload  Archive
      description: "DescriptionThis operation adds an archive to a vault. For a successful
        upload, your data is durably\n\t\t\tpersisted. In response, Amazon Glacier
        returns the archive ID in the\n\t\t\t\tx-amz-archive-id header of the response.
        You should save the archive ID\n\t\t\treturned so that you can access the
        archive later. You must provide a SHA256 tree hash of the data you are uploading.
        For information about\n\t\t\tcomputing a SHA256 tree hash, see Computing Checksums.
        When uploading an archive, you can optionally specify an archive description
        of up to 1,024\n\t\t\tprintable ASCII characters. Amazon Glacier returns the
        archive description when you\n\t\t\teither retrieve the archive or get the
        vault inventory. Amazon Glacier does not interpret the\n\t\t\tdescription
        in any way. An archive description does not need to be unique. You cannot\n\t\t\tuse
        the description to retrieve or sort the archive list. Except for the optional
        archive description, Amazon Glacier does not support any\n\t\t\tadditional
        metadata for the archives. The archive ID is an opaque sequence of characters\n\t\t\tfrom
        which you cannot infer any meaning about the archive. So you might maintain\n\t\t\tmetadata
        about the archives on the client-side. For more information, see \n\t\t\tWorking
        with Archives in Amazon Glacier.Archives are immutable. After you upload an
        archive, you cannot edit the archive or its\n\t\t\tdescription. RequestsTo
        upload an archive, you use the HTTP POST method and scope the request to the\n\t\t\t\tarchives
        subresource of the vault in which you want to save the\n\t\t\tarchive. The
        request must include the archive payload size, checksum (SHA256 tree hash),\n\t\t\tand
        can optionally include a description of the archive."

        retrieve an archive or retrieve a vault inventory from Amazon Glacier, you
        first initiate\n\t\t\ta job, and after the job completes, you download the
        data. For an archive retrieval, the\n\t\t\toutput is the archive data. For
        an inventory retrieval, it is the inventory list.\n\t\t\tThe List Job operation
        returns a list of these jobs sorted by job initiation\n\t\t\ttime.The List
        Jobs operation supports pagination. You should always check the response\n\t\t\t\tMarker
        field. If there are no more jobs to list, the\n\t\t\t\tMarker field is set
        to null. If there are more jobs to\n\t\t\tlist, the Marker field is set to
        a non-null value, which you can use to\n\t\t\tcontinue the pagination of the
        list. To return a list of jobs that begins at a specific\n\t\t\tjob, set the
        marker request parameter to the Marker value for\n\t\t\tthat job that you
        obtained from a previous List Jobs request.You can set a maximum limit for
        the number of jobs returned in the response by specifying\n\t\t\tthe limit
        parameter in the request. The default limit is 1000. The number\n\t\t\tof
        jobs returned might be fewer than the limit but the number of returned jobs
        never\n\t\t\texceeds the limit.Additionally, you can filter the jobs list
        returned by specifying the optional\n\t\t\tstatuscode parameter or completed
        parameter, or both. Using\n\t\t\tthe statuscode parameter, you can specify
        to return only jobs that match\n\t\t\teither the InProgress, Succeeded, or
        Failed status.\n\t\t\tUsing the completed parameter, you can specify to return

        DescriptionThis operation completes the vault locking process by transitioning the vault lock from
                 the InProgress state to the Locked state, which causes the vault
                 lock policy to become unchangeable. A vault lock is put into the InProgress
                 state by calling Initiate Vault Lock (POST lock-policy). You can obtain the state of the vault lock by
                 calling Get Vault Lock (GET lock-policy). For more
                 information about the vault locking process, see Amazon Glacier Vault Lock. This operation is idempotent. This request is always successful if the vault lock is in the
                 Locked state and the provided lock ID matches the lock ID originally used to
                 lock the vault.If an invalid lock ID is passed in the request when the vault lock is in the Locked state,
                 the operation returns an AccessDeniedException error. If an invalid lock ID is
                 passed in the request when the vault lock is in the InProgress state, the operation throws an
                    InvalidParameter error.RequestsTo complete the vault locking process, send an HTTP POST request to the URI
                 of the vault's lock-policy subresource with a valid lock ID.
